# ORA Roadmap

## Current Prototype – ORA v0.2
- Band-level Population Pressure Index (PPI) based on approximate cataloged objects
- Operator Fleet Pressure Index (OFPI) using archetypal operator profiles
- Public API + public prototype site
- Transparent documentation + methodology

---

## Planned Milestones

### ORA v0.3 – More Granular Orbit Understanding
- Break LEO into sub-bands (e.g., 300–500 km, 500–800 km, >1000 km)
- Show how congestion varies within LEO instead of treating it as a single block
- Begin anchoring values to specific public SSA datasets

### ORA v0.4 – Operator Responsibility Layer (Early)
- Add high-level disposal / compliance signals to operators
- Still illustrative, but directionally aligned with policy expectations
- Clarify that this is not enforcement — it’s a transparency and awareness layer

### ORA v0.5 – Toward Real Data Integration
- Explore ingesting publicly accessible SSA sources
- Move select values from static approximation → periodically refreshed reality
- Begin outlining how ORA could support:
  - regulators
  - insurers
  - responsible operators

## Philosophy
ORA prioritizes:
- transparency over mystique
- explainability over black-box scoring
- responsibility framing over punishment framing
