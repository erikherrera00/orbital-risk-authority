I'm working on a prototype called **Orbital Risk Authority (ORA)** – an independent
effort to build an Orbital Risk Index (ORI) for Earth orbit.

Right now ORA v0.2 exposes:

- a band-level view (LEO / MEO / GEO) with a Population Pressure Index (PPI) derived
  from approximate cataloged object counts, and
- an operator-level Fleet Pressure view using archetypal operator profiles in LEO,
  MEO, and GEO.

Everything is explicitly marked as illustrative, but the goal is to move toward an
explainable, data-driven framework that could eventually support regulators, insurers,
and operators in understanding where congestion and systemic pressure are building up.

If you're open to it, I'd value a quick sanity check or critique on the structure and
direction – especially what you think is missing or what would make this more useful
to people working in [SSA / regulation / insurance / operations].
