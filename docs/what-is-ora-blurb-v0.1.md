Orbital Risk Authority (ORA) is an independent prototype initiative focused on measuring
orbital congestion and responsibility.

ORA’s core output is the Orbital Risk Index (ORI), a structured scoring framework that
looks at:

- how crowded different orbital regimes are (LEO, MEO, GEO),
- how much pressure large fleets place on the system,
- and, over time, how disposal practices and transparency affect long-term risk.

The current prototype exposes:

- a global band-level view, including a Population Pressure Index (PPI) derived from
  approximate cataloged object counts, and
- an operator-level Fleet Pressure Index (OFPI) based on relative fleet dominance.

All values are illustrative and explicitly labeled as such. The goal of ORA is to
build an explainable, data-driven foundation that can eventually support regulators,
insurers, and operators as orbital environments become more crowded and strategically
important.
